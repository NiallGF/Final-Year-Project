# Final-Year-Project
Repository for my final year project

The project will contain all data files from the NHANES project.

Week by week, the work will be added to as I progress through the project.

In have also ordered the files in the sequence they are completed: the first files will be practise in trying to replicate a study or testing out code. Following this the file numbers will work through cleaning, eda, feature selection and models. 

Once the project is complete, the paper will be uplaoded so my findings can be explored fully.

Thanks for reading!!
